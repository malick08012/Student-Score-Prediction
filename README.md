# Student Score Prediction using Linear Regression:
A machine learning project focused on predicting student outcomes using the Student Performance Factors dataset.  Can we predict final exam scores using study hours and lifestyle data? Explore this regression-based project to see how features like study time and previous score and exam score impact student performance.

🧠 Conclusion

Study hours positively influence exam score, but they explain only 23% of performance variation. Adding previous scores slightly improves prediction accuracy. This indicates that multiple academic and personal factors contribute to student performance.
